# Air France Internet Marketing Analysis

## Overview
This project, completed as part of the MIS 6373 course "Social Media" at the University of Texas at Dallas, focuses on optimizing Air France's sponsored search campaigns on major search engines like Google, Yahoo!, MSN, and Kayak. The goal is to analyze campaign metrics to derive strategies that enhance ad spend returns and maximize performance for each publisher.

## Project Structure
The project files include reports, data, and a solution spreadsheet as outlined below:

### File List

### File Descriptions
- **Air France Case.pdf**  
  A detailed report offering background on Air Franceâ€™s Internet marketing strategy and sponsored search campaigns on Google, Yahoo!, MSN, and Kayak. It includes data on click charges, revenue, and campaign performance across various publishers.

- **Air France Internet Marketing.doc**  
  Contains the requirements for the project, specifying analysis tasks, KPIs, and expected deliverables.

- **Air France Internet Marketing.xls**  
  The provided spreadsheet supplement that consolidates summarized metrics for each campaign, including click volume, bookings, ad costs, and other metrics essential to the analysis.

- **Answers.xls**  
  Solution file with PivotTables, charts, and calculations used to evaluate performance and strategy for each publisher. The analysis focuses on return on ad dollar spent (ROA), cost per click (CPC), revenue per booking, and other performance indicators.

## Objective
The primary goal is to assess the effectiveness of Air France's Internet marketing across multiple platforms by analyzing summarized campaign metrics. Specifically, the project aims to:
1. Determine the optimal strategy for each publisher.
2. Identify top-performing campaigns and keywords.
3. Recommend strategies to increase bookings and maximize revenue.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
To gauge the performance of each publisher, we defined eight KPIs:
1. **Net Revenue**: Total revenue generated from bookings.
2. **Cost Per Click (CPC)**: Average cost incurred for each ad click.
3. **Total Volume of Bookings**: Total number of bookings generated.
4. **Revenue Per Booking**: Average revenue generated per booking.
5. **Return on Ad Dollar Spent (ROA)**: Measures ad spend efficiency by calculating the revenue generated per dollar spent.
6. **Probability of Booking**: The likelihood of booking based on clicks.
7. **Click Charges**: Sum of all click costs.
8. **Cost/Booking**: Total cost incurred per booking.

## Analysis Process
1. **Data Consolidation and PivotTable Creation**  
   - Created a PivotTable to display campaign performance for each publisher, with filters for keywords, ROA, and CPC.
  
2. **Quadrant Analysis**  
   - Extracted two metrics, **Probability of Booking** (X-axis) and **Cost Per Click** (Y-axis), to construct four quadrants that categorize each publisher's strategy:
     - **High Probability, Low Cost**: Publishers likely to yield profitable returns.
     - **High Probability, High Cost**: Publishers worth pursuing but with caution on ad spend.
     - **Low Probability, Low Cost**: Publishers with potential but low risk.
     - **Low Probability, High Cost**: Publishers needing close monitoring and possibly de-prioritization.

3. **Publisher Comparison**  
   - Compared publisher performance on all eight KPIs, highlighting which platforms bring in higher net revenue, lower cost per booking, and better ROA.

## Insights and Recommendations
- Provided actionable insights into publisher performance and suggested strategic approaches for ad spend allocation, prioritization, and keyword adjustments.
- Recommendations are based on the quadrant analysis, helping Air France identify high-value publishers and determine the most cost-effective platforms.

## Conclusion
This analysis helped identify which publishers and keywords perform best under Air France's current internet marketing strategy. The quadrant analysis aids in making informed decisions about ad spend distribution, maximizing both revenue and booking volumes across different platforms.
